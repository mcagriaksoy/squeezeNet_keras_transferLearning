# squeezeNet_keras_transferLearning
The squeezeNet with keras transfer learning examples and usage on google colaboratory jupyler notebook!

 - SqueezeNet: AlexNet-level accuracy with 50x fewer parameters and <0.5MB model size WOW!
 
 Due to wiki: In designing SqueezeNet, the authors' goal was to create a smaller neural network with fewer parameters that can more easily fit into computer memory and can more easily be transmitted over a computer network.
 
 But unluckly, the keras does not support this wonderful network:

 So why do not we implement it. Apperenly, my friend @rcmalli has created a installer for keras but it is not working on google colaboratory environment with newer keras tf versions in case of meaningless changing library calls in every version of keras :(
 
 I have created a solution, have a nice day. Best.
 # cifar-10 demo
 I also would like to provide a demo that uses cifar10 with/out squeezenet pretrained imagenet weights.
